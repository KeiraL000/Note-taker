# Note taker application

## Description
This application allows users to easily type down notes, add them to a list of saved notes, and delete said notes.

## How to use
In order to use this application, simply enter the title of your note, the details, and then click the save icon on the top right of the screen! The Note will appear on the left-hand side of the screen with a trashcan icon. If you'd like to delete any notes from your saved list, you can click the trashcan beside the note you'd like to delete.
